# Transboundary River Basins' Endemic Species
## **Introduction**

Transboundary river basins are important from both biodiversity and political perspectives.
From a biodiversity standpoint, these ecosystems house a high diversity of species (Mason et al., 2020), many of which are 100% endemic[^1], occurring solely within that specific region (Blankespoor et al., 2025).
Politically, they present a complex situation, as the area of the basin extends across more than one sovereign region.
This means that both benefits and challenges must be shared among different nations, which can lead to disputes and neglect of the basins (Bakker & Duncan, 2016).

[^1]: For simplicity, we will refer to species that are 100% endemic as *endemic species* throughout this project.

Therefore, to ensure the sustainable management of basin resources and the preservation of their biodiversity, broad cooperation between nations is essential (Grey et al., 2009).
In this project, we aim to explore the continental impact on these studies.
By understanding the regional distribution of endemic species, we can contribute to guiding political efforts toward continent-specific collaboration.
We will study how the distribution of endemic species varies across different continents.
Two approaches will be used: one considering the absolute number of endemic species, and another considering the proportion of endemic species relative to the total number of species found in each basin.

Additionally, given that many basins have not yet been fully mapped (Revenga & Tyrrell, 2016), it is also important to investigate whether it is possible to predict the number of endemic species expected in a basin based on its area and the continent in which it is located.

Based on these considerations, we formulated the following research questions to better understand the distribution and predictability of endemic species in transboundary river basins:

### **Research Questions**

1.  Is there a difference in the quantity of endemic species found in a basin depending on its continent of origin?

2.  Is there a difference in the proportion of endemic species compared to all species encountered in a basin depending on its continent of origin?

3.  Is it possible to predict the number of endemic species found in a basin considering its area and continent?

For answering them we will be using the following data set:


### **Data set**

-   **Provider**: World Bank

-   **Name**: Species Richness and Count of Species at Risk in Transboundary River Basins

-   **Group**: Global Biodiversity

-   **Data File**: [`tfddbasins_species_summary_ddh.csv`](https://datacatalogfiles.worldbank.org/ddh-published/0066034/10/DR0094740/tfddbasins_species_summary_ddh.csv)

## Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that, although it is possible to predict the number of endemic species found in a basin based on its area and continent, the continental aspect is not fully significant.
The location of a basin was not a significant predictor when comparing Asia and Africa to Europe.
Additionally, the number of endemic species found in a basin appears to be independent of the continent in which it is located, and the proportion of endemic species relative to total basin diversity is only significantly different when the basin is located in Europe.

On one hand, this could suggest better opportunities for global collaboration and information exchange, given that basins do not differ significantly across continents considering the variables studied.
On the other hand, this level of grouping was not sufficient to capture enough individual characteristics to effectively guide political efforts for the preservation of these ecosystems.
